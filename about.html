              >I’m a web developer whose curiosity brought him into this field
              and is also keeping him here. I remember vividly in 2019 walking
              to the bathroom at my job and I happened to walk past the
              developers desk. I immediately stopped in my tracks at the sight
              of what looked liked colorful gibberish on his laptop and I had to
              ask what it was. He then introduced me to the world of coding and
              it truly piqued my interest.</strong
            >
            <span
              >From then on, I started doing my own research, taking courses and
              really began my journey to web development. After a year and a
              half of trying to do things myself, I realized I needed community
              to keep me grounded and focused. So I joined a bootcamp in 2021
              and the rest is history.</span

            I have spent the past years delivering high-quality code within
            established deadlines while adhering to industry best practices and
            shipping products successfully to clients. I have also taken much
            time through education, up-skilling and consistent practice to equip
            myself with relevant skills, expertise and modern software knowledge
            required to thrive in this field. My current and past experiences on
            teams have taught me how to collaborate effectively with
            cross-functional teams throughout the development lifecycle,
            ensuring seamless integration and delivery of software products. My
            experience as a freelancer has also empowered me to work
            independently as the lead on multiple projects simultaneously while
            honing my ability to articulate development processes effectively to
            clients. If there’s one thing bootcamp taught me - other than
            equipping me with a strong foundation, it’s resilience. Pushing
            through against all odds no matter what and making sure to serve up
            a successful launch.

            In my spare time, I like sharing content to encourage others making
            their way through their web development journey and using my story
            to let them know, <br />
            they too can make the change they are seeking. Below are a few fun
            facts about me.
